Kotlin: From Language to Application, Ready to Ride 

Have you wondered what all this excitement about Kotlin is? Come see Venkat Subramaniam (@venkat_s) and Josh Long (@starbuxman) introduce the wonderful capabilities of Kotlinâ€”like its ability to reduce mountains of code to most elegant expressions, support for rich internal DSLs, facilities for both functional programming and object oriented programming, and the power to do asynchronous programming with coroutines. Then watch them take the language to where your applications are, the server side, the mobile, and frontend.
