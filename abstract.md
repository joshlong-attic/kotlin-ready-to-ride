# Kotlin: Ready to Ride 



There's probably not going to be another general purpose programming language on the order of C or Java, but that doesn't mean your programming language has to limit you in 2018, either. Meet Kotlin, a language that's ready to ride. 

Come hear Dr. Venkat Subramaniam (@venkat_s) and Josh Long (@starbuxman) discuss the wonderful capabilities of Kotlin, its ability to create DSLs, support coroutines, and then watch them take the language where your applications are, on the server side, mobile, and beyond. 


## To Do: 

* look into a simple Kotlin and Android application 
* look into a Spring Boot Kotloin application 
* look into a simple Kotlin Native application 
* look into a Kotlin Gradle build 
* look into a Kotlin.js app
